How to use the mk_zones_from_yaml.py tool?

Assume the node YAML files are located in:
/var/lib/hiera/depzones/dmsat1/hosts

We use the bind-chroot RPM. This means that the zone files
are located in:
/var/named/chroot/var/named

and, the configuration is located in:
/var/named/chroot/etc

The name of our DNS server is:
dns1.svcs.dmsat1.org

Now, we can run the tool with:
mk_zones_from_yaml.py -n dns1.svcs.dmsat1.org \
  /var/lib/hiera/depzones/dmsat1/hosts
